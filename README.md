## Product Management Task

### ðŸ“¦ Spring Boot Product Management API

A simple Spring Boot application that provides RESTful APIs to manage products. It includes:

* `ProductController` to handle HTTP requests
* `ProductService` for business logic
* `ProductRepository` using in-memory storage
* Basic POST and GET endpoints to create and retrieve products

This project demonstrates clean architecture and proper layering **(Controller, Service, Repository)** in a Spring Boot application.
